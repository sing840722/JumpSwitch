## Introudction
This game is created during Global Game Jam Brain Eden 2016 in Anglia Ruskin University. In a team of five, we have been given three days to create a game with the given theme "Parity". We have chosen "Colours" to incorporate with "Parity" where player will proceed only if they select/change to different colour evenly.

Jump from rooftop to rooftop to get a highscore

Press a colour that matches the building you want to jump to

But be careful where you tap as if you land on the wrong building you fail
